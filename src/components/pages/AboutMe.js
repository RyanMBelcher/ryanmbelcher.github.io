            <p>
                I am a full stack web developer with a bias towards front end development. I recently earned a full stack web development certificate
                from the University of Pennsylvania, where I developed skills in HTML, CSS, JS, OOP, MVC, ORM, SQL, MongoDB, React.JS, and
                responsive web design.

                I have a background in the banking and mortgage industries which helped to develop my problem solving skills which I am excited to
                now bring to the software development world.

                In my spare time, I enjoy running, traveling, cooking, and chilling with my wife.
